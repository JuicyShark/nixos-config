## DO NOT STEAL BLINDLY

You think the author's configuration is well formed and a good place to learn from?

**Think Again.**

This config has evolved over the lifetime of quickshell itself and my own learning of QML with
very little maintenance. If you are going to steal something please pay close attention to what
it is doing and why, because it may be a wrong or inefficient way of solving the problem.

This will eventually undergo a refactor to be made presentable but it currently is not, and
should not be treated as a good place to learn from, which is why it isn't linked on any
quickshell pages.
